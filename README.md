# tvshows-list-details
## About
Application is built using React.js a progressive javascript library created by Jordan Walke at facebook.
We used Jest for testing purpose.We used react.js over other frameworks because of its popularity and easy to use ecosystem, fast compilation, easy learning curve and its easy to use syntax which gives upper hand over other frameworks in writing code faster.Application is about the tv shows on different genres and user can see the details about the particular show as well as search a show using its name.
